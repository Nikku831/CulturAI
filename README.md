## Problem Statement
In the global market, businesses face challenges in creating content that resonates across cultures. Metaphors, symbols, and humor that work in one culture may offend or confuse another. Elements like colors, animals, and religious references vary in meaning across regions. While many translation tools exist, they often fail to capture these cultural nuances, leading to misunderstandings and reduced engagement. 

## Solution
CulturAI addresses this gap by going beyond simple translation to tailor content for specific regions. Powered by IBM watsonx.ai and Granite models, it analyzes and adjusts for local traditions, communication styles, and cultural norms. This AI-based tool helps businesses avoid cultural missteps and ensures messages resonate with diverse audiences, enhancing engagement and protecting brand reputation.

## Features
- Cultural Sensitivity: Adapts idioms, metaphors, and culturally relevant terms to match regional preferences.
- Nuance Detection: Flags potential cultural missteps (e.g., alcohol references in restricted regions) and suggests alternatives.
- Localized Tone: Automatically adjusts the tone and formality of content for specific cultures.
- Real-time Updates: Leverages a dynamic cultural database, ensuring content stays relevant to evolving regional trends.
